        <h2>Garden of Gamelan (Solo)</h2>
        <p>Garden of Gamelan is a game I made in 9 weeks in Unreal Engine 5 for my final solo MSc project. The game is an atmospheric 3D platformer featuring a generative music system in which
          the soundtrack is generated in real-time and is completely determined by the player's inputs and actions in the game. With gameplay inspired by Jet Set Radio and Super Mario 64, the
          player can jump from wall to wall and make incredible leaps by gaining height and then converting their potential energy into super-charged long jumps. Explore the floating gardens as your actions create 
          a musical soundscape inspired by traditional Indonesian music. I wrote a report documenting its creation <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BaAspBDC5gyMKwdsFTv2wIdtqJ1etZcb/view?usp=drive_link">which you can read here.</a>

        <h2>Impossible Rescue (Programmer)</h2>
        <p>Impossible Rescue is a team project I worked on as part of my Game Development MSc at Birmingham City University. Play as Danielle, a space mercenary sent to mars to recover stolen data and
          uncover secrets about the Martian Empire in this Metroid meets The Ascent twin-stick shooter. With a team of two designers, eight artists and two other programmers, I worked on programming most of the main 
          gameplay elements including character movement, health, weapons, enemies and level logic such as doors and timers.

        <h2>Sinner's Spire (Programmer)</h2>
        <p>Sinner's Spire is the second team project I worked on during my MSc. The game is a fast-paced arcade FPS where you play as a deceased triad member who has woken up in an afterlife reminiscent
          of the hell of traditional Chinese folklore. On this project I made the character and HUD, creating a dash system inspired by Doom Eternal.

        <h2>SDL2/C++ Game Engine (Solo)</h2>
        <p>This is a small project I made from the ground up using C++ and the SDL2 library. It's a simple platformer game made in its own engine featuring a custom sprite animation system, tile-based levels, randomised tile variation,
        parallax backgrounds, entitiy collisions and a smooth room-based camera system. The player can jump, double jump, dash forward and slam into the ground, all accompanied with satisfying audio and visual effects. Find keys
        to open doors and avoid enemies that trace the perimiter of the castle walls.

        <h2>Rayman AFG (Artist)</h2>
        <p>This is a Rayman fan project created in 2015 with a small team of dedicated Rayman enthusiasts. On this project I worked as an artist, contributing textures including butterflies, wooden bridges and metal cages.

        <h2>Deed of the Dead (Solo)</h2>
        <p>This was my first attempt at a polished project, a Metroidvania-style platformer combining elements of the Mario and Zelda franchises. The game was built in the Fusion 2.5 engine and features 6 key items
          including a bow, a grappling hook and magic stones that allow you to shrink and expand.

        <h2>Game Boy Homebrew (Solo)</h2>
        <p>I've always had a childhood dream of creating my own Game Boy game, so in 2017 I started learning C and the GBDK library. I made a number of small projects from scratch including a maze game with tile-based collision detection
          and a simple recreation of the game Flappy Bird which was transferred to an Everdrive Game Boy cartridge.
