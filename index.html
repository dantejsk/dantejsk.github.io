    <p>I've been creating my own games since the age of 9, starting with small projects using game engines made to entertain my friends.
      As I became more interested in the underlying mechanisms that make video games work, I started learning languages such as C, C++ and Python during my free time while in secondary school and
      began creating games from scratch.

      I've been teaching myself jazz piano and improvisation since 2020, and have been studying and composing classical music since 2018. I have been most influenced by 
      jazz, hip-hop, classical, progressive rock and video game music.

      I've loved drawing since I was a toddler, creating optical illusions and fantastical creatures from as far back as I can remember.
      Some of my biggest inspirations are M. C. Escher, Hieronymus Bosch and my grandparents, Colin Saxton and Josephone Howard.
